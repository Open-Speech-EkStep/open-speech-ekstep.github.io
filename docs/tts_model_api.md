## About The Project

Text To Speech (TTS), also known as Speech Synthesis, is a process where text is converted into a human-sounding voice. TTS has been a popular choice for developers and business users alike when building IVR (Interactive Voice Response) solutions and other voice applications, as it accelerates time to production without having to record audio files with human voices. Using recorded files requires recording each message with a human voice, whereas TTS prompts can be dynamically generated from raw text.

Our TTS service can enable us to generate life-like speech synthesis in both male and females voices for an array of Indic languages like Hindi,Tamil,Malayalam,Kannada and many more.

This API is enabled to provide the following features:

* Support for Indic only languages.

* No software Installation required.

* Cloud based robust API.

* Two gender voices for every language.

* Fast and easy integration.

* Cross platform capability.
