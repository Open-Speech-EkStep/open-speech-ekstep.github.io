# vakyansh-tts

## Models
Our open-sourced TTS models for Indic languages are present in this [repo](https://github.com/Open-Speech-EkStep/vakyansh-models).

## Components
There are two models at work that convert your text to an audio. First of all, we train a glow-TTS text-to-mel model to convert text to mel spectrogram. This mel spectrogram is then passed as input to a mel-to-wav model (HiFi-GAN) which converts it to an audio.


1. Text to Mel: We use _Glow-TTS: A Generative Flow for Text-to-Speech via Monotonic Alignment Search_ proposed [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11129). You can find the original source code implemented by the authors [here](https://github.com/jaywalnut310/glow-tts).

2. Mel to Wav: We use _HiFi-GAN: a GAN-based model capable of generating high fidelity speech efficiently_ proposed [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05646).

## 1. Installation and Setup for training

Clone repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Open-Speech-EkStep/vakyansh-tts
```
Note: If you're interested in training a multi-speaker glow-tts for Text to Mel conversion, you can clone the _multispeaker_ branch from [here](https://github.com/Open-Speech-EkStep/vakyansh-tts/tree/multispeaker) or:

```
git clone https://github.com/Open-Speech-EkStep/vakyansh-tts -b multispeaker
```

Build conda virtual environment
```
cd ./vakyansh-tts
conda create --name <env_name> python=3.7
conda activate <env_name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install [apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex); commit: 37cdaf4 for Mixed-precision training

Note: this is needed for glow-tts training
```
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex
cd apex
git checkout 37cdaf4
pip install -v --disable-pip-version-check --no-cache-dir ./
cd ../vakyansh-tts
```
Build Monotonic Alignment Search Code (Cython)
```
bash install.sh
```
## 2. Data Resampling

The data format should have a folder containing all the .wav files for glow-tts and a text file containing filenames with their sentences.

Directory structure: 

langauge_folder_name
```
language_folder_name
|-- ./wav/*.wav
|-- ./text_file_name.txt
```
The format for text_file_name.txt (Text file is only needed for glow-tts training)

```
( audio1.wav "Sentence1." )
( audio2.wav "Sentence2." )
```

To resample the .wav files to 22050 sample rate, change the following parameters in the vakyansh-tts/scripts/data/resample.sh

```
input_wav_path : absolute path to wav file folder in vakyansh_tts/data/
output_wav_path : absolute path to vakyansh_tts/data/resampled_wav_folder_name
output_sample_rate : 22050 (or any other desired sample rate)
```

To run:  
```bash
cd scripts/data/
bash resample.sh
```


## 3. Spectogram Training (glow-tts)

### 3.1 Data Preparation


To prepare the data edit the vakyansh-tts/scripts/glow/prepare_data.sh file and change the following parameters
```
input_text_path : absolute path to vakyansh_tts/data/text_file_name.txt
input_wav_path : absolute path to vakyansh_tts/data/resampled_wav_folder_name
gender : female or male voice
```
To run:  
```bash
cd scripts/glow/
bash prepare_data.sh
```
### 3.2 Training glow-tts

To start the spectogram-training edit the vakyansh-tts/scripts/glow/train_glow.sh file and change the following parameter:
```
gender : female or male voice
```
Make sure that the gender is same as that of the prepare_data.sh file

To start the training, run:  
```bash
cd scripts/glow/
bash train_glow.sh
```
## 4. Vocoder Training (hifi-gan)

### 4.1 Data Preparation

To prepare the data edit the vakyansh-tts/scripts/hifi/prepare_data.sh file and change the following parameters
```
input_wav_path : absolute path to vakyansh_tts/data/resampled_wav_folder_name
gender : female or male voice
```
To run:  
```bash
cd scripts/hifi/
bash prepare_data.sh
```
### 4.2 Training hifi-gan

To start the spectogram-training edit the vakyansh-tts/scripts/hifi/train_hifi.sh file and change the following parameter:
```

```
### 5.2 Using fast API 
To use the fast api link edit the parameters in the vakyansh-tts/scripts/inference/api.sh file similar to section 5.1

To run:  
```bash
cd scripts/inference/
bash api.sh
```

### 5.3 Direct Inference using text  
To infer, edit the parameters in the vakyansh-tts/scripts/inference/infer.sh file similar to section 5.1 and set the text to the text variable

To run:  
```bash
cd scripts/inference/
bash infer.sh
```

To configure other parameters there is a version that runs the advanced inference as well. Additional Parameters:
```
noise_scale : can vary from 0 to 1 for noise factor
length_scale : can vary from 0 to 2 for changing the speed of the generated audio 
transliteration : whether to switch on/off transliteration. 1: ON, 0: OFF
number_conversion : whether to switch on/off number to words conversion. 1: ON, 0: OFF
split_sentences : whether to switch on/off splitting of sentences. 1: ON, 0: OFF
```
To run:
```
cd scripts/inference/
bash advanced_infer.sh
```

def translit(text, lang):
    reg = re.compile(r'[a-zA-Z]')

    updated_sent = ' '.join(words)
    return updated_sent

    text_num_to_word = normalize_nums(text, lang) # converting numbers to words in lang
    text_num_to_word_and_transliterated = translit(text_num_to_word, lang) # transliterating english words to lang
    
    mel = text_to_mel.generate_mel(text_num_to_word_and_transliterated)
