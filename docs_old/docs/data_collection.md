# Data Collection Pipeline

![Screenshot](img/Data_collection_pipeline.png)


## About The Project
This is downloading framework that is extensible and allows the user to add new source without much code changes. For each new source user need to write a scrapy spider script and rest of downloading and meta file creation is handled by repective pipelines. If required, user can add their custom pipelines. This framework automatically transfer the downloaded data to a Google cloud bucket. For more info on writing scrapy spider and pipeline one can refer to the [documentation](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html). 
Data Collection Pipeline’s developer documentation is meant for its adopters, developers and contributors.

The developer documentation helps you to get familiar with the bare necessities, giving you a quick and clean approach to get you up and running. If you are looking for ways to customize the workflow, or just breaking things down to build them back up, head to the reference section to dig into the mechanics of Data Collection Pipeline.

Data Collection Pipeline is based on an open platform, you are free to use any programming language to extend or customize it but we prefer to use python to perform smart scraping.

The Developer documentation provides you with a complete set of guidelines which you need to:

* Install Data Collection Pipeline  
* Configure Data Collection Pipeline  
* Customize Data Collection Pipeline  
* Extend Data Collection Pipeline  
* Contribute to Data Collection Pipeline  




### Built With
We have used scrapy as the base of this framework.
* [Scrapy](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy)

### Summary

This summary mentions the key advantages and limitations of this smart crawler service. 

**Youtube Crawler**

  - Key Points and Advantages:
      * Get language relevant channels from YouTube and download videos from them.(70%-80% relevancy with language - based on Manual Analysis)
      * Can fetch channels with Creative Commons video and download the videos in them as well.(70% relevancy with language)
      * Can download using file mode(manually filled with video Ids) or channel mode.
      * Youtube-dl can fetch N number of videos from a channel and download them.
      * YouTube crawler downloads files at a rate of maximum of 2000 hours per day  and minimum of 800 hours per day.
      * Youtube crawler is more convenient and it’s a main source of Creative Commons data that can be accessed easily.
      * It can be deployed in cloud service called zyte used for scraping/crawling.
      * License information of videos are available in metadata.
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
  - Limitations:
      * Youtube-api cannot return more than 500 videos per channel.(when using YOUTUBE_API mode in configuration)
      * Youtube-api is restricted to 10000 tokens per day in free mode.
          1. 10000 tokens can be used to get license info of 10000 videos.(in any mode)
          2. 10000 tokens can be used to get 5000 channels.(in YOUTUBE_API mode)
          3. Youtube-dl can be used to get all videos freely.(in YOUTUBE_DL mode)
      * Cannot fetch data from specific playlist.
        (Solution: Fetch videos Ids of a playlist using YouTube-dl and put them in a file and download in file mode.)
      * Rare cases in which you might get Too many requests error from Youtube-DL.
        (Solution: Rerun the application with same sources.)
      * Cannot download videos which require user information and private videos.

**Web Crawler**

  - Key Points and Advantages:
      * Web crawler can download specific language audio but with around 50 - 60% relevance.
      * Web crawler downloads files at a rate of at least 2000 hours per day.
      * It is a faster means of downloading data.
      * Creative Commons license of videos can be identified if available while crawling websites.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  - Limitations:
      * Web crawler is not finely tuned yet, so downloaded content might have low language relevance. 
      * It cannot be deployed in zyte service free accounts and can be only deployed in zyte service paid accounts where docker container creation can be customised.
      * License information of videos in web crawler cannot be automatically identified but requires some manual intervention.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
This framework allows the user to download the media file from a websource(youtube, xyz.com, etc) and creates the respective metadata file from the data that is extracted from the file.For using any added source or to add new source refer to steps below.It can also crawl internet for media of a specific language. For web crawling, refer to the web crawl configuration below.
### Common configuration steps:
#### Setting credentials for Google cloud bucket
You can set credentials for Google cloud bucket in the [credentials.json](https://github.com/Open-Speech-EkStep/data-acquisition-pipeline/blob/master/credentials.json) add the credentials in given manner
It can be found in the project root folder.
```sh
{"Credentials":{ YOUR ACCOUNT CREDENTIAL KEYS }}
```

**Note:**
All configuration files can be found in the following path  `data-acquisition-pipeline/data_acquisition_framework/configs/`
#### Bucket configuration
Bucket configurations for data transfer in [storage_config.json](https://github.com/Open-Speech-EkStep/data-acquisition-pipeline/blob/master/data_acquisition_framework/configs/storage_config.json) 
```sh
"bucket": "ekstepspeechrecognition-dev",          Your bucket name
"channel_blob_path": "scrapydump/refactor_test",  Path to directory where downloaded files is to be stored
"archive_blob_path": "archive",                   Folder name in which history of download is to be maintained
"channels_file_blob_path": "channels",            Folder name in which channels and its videos are saved 
"scraped_data_blob_path": "data_to_be_scraped"    Folder name in which CSV for youtube file mode is stored

Note:
1. The scraped_data_blob_path folder should be present inside the channel_blob_path folder.
2. The CSV file used in file mode of youtube and its name must be same as source_name given above. 
3. (only for datacollector_urls and datacollector_bing spiders) To autoconfigure language parameter to channel_blob_path from web_crawler_config.json, use <language> in channel_blob_path.  
    "eg: for tamil : data/download/<language>/audio - this will replace <language> with tamil."
4. The archive_blob_path and channels_file_blob_path are folders that will be autogenerated in bucket with the given name.
```

#### Adding new spider
As we already mentioned our framework is extensible for any new source. To add a new source user just need to write a spider for that source.<br>To add a spider you can follow the scrapy [documentation](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html) or you can check our [sample](https://github.com/Open-Speech-EkStep/data-acquisition-pipeline/blob/master/data_acquisition_framework/spiders/datacollector_music.py) spider.</br> 

<!-- RUNNING THE SERVICES -->
## Running services

Make sure the google credentials are present in project root folder in credentials.json file.

#### Youtube spider in channel mode:

1. In `data_acqusition_framework/configs`, do the following:
    - Open `config.json` and change `language` and `type` to your respective use case.
    
    - Open `storage_config.json` and change `bucket` and `channel_blob_path` to your respective gcp paths.(For more info on these fields, scroll above to Bucket configuration)
    
    - Open `youtube_pipeline_config.py` and change mode to channel`(eg: mode='channel')`
    
2. There are two ways to download videos of youtube channels:
    - You can hardcode the channel url and channel name.
    
    - You can use youtube-utils service(youtube-dl/youtube data api) to fetch channels and its respective videos information.
    
3. To download by hardcoding the channel urls, do the following:
    - Open `data_acqusition_framework/configs/youtube_pipeline_config.py` and do the following:
    
    - Add the channel_urls and its names in `channel_url_dict` variable.
        
        ```
        eg. channel_url_dict = { 
           "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2XEzs5R1mn2wTKgtjuMxiQ": "channel_name_a",
           "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2XEzs5R1mn2wTKgtjuMxiQ":"channel_name_b" 
        }
       ```
   
    - Set `youtube_service_to_use` variable value to either `YoutubeService.YOUTUBE_DL` or `YoutubeService.YOUTUBE_API` for collecting video info.
    
    - If `YoutubeService.YOUTUBE_API` is chosen, then get APIKEY for youtube data api from google developer console and store it in a file called `.youtube_api_key` in project root folder.
   
    - From the project root folder, run the following command:
        
        ```
        scrapy crawl datacollector_youtube --set=ITEM_PIPELINES='{"data_acquisition_framework.pipelines.youtube_api_pipeline.YoutubeApiPipeline": 1}'
        ```
   
    - This will start fetching the videos from youtube for the given channels and download them to bucket.

4. To download by using youtube-utils service, do the following:
    - Open `data_acqusition_framework/configs/youtube_pipeline_config.py` and do the following:
        - Assign `channel_url_dict = {}`(If not empty, will not work).
        - Set `youtube_service_to_use` variable value to either `YoutubeService.YOUTUBE_DL` or `YoutubeService.YOUTUBE_API` for collecting video info.
        - If `YoutubeService.YOUTUBE_API` is chosen, then get APIKEY for youtube data api from google developer console and store it in a file called `.youtube_api_key` in project root folder.
    
    - Open `data_acqusition_framework/configs/youtube_api_config.json` and change the fields to your requirements.(For more info: check above in Youtube api configuration)
    
    - From the project root folder, run the following command:
      
        ```
         scrapy crawl datacollector_youtube --set=ITEM_PIPELINES='{"data_acquisition_framework.pipelines.youtube_api_pipeline.YoutubeApiPipeline": 1}'
        ```
      
    - This will start fetching the videos from youtube for the given channels and download them to bucket.
    
#### Youtube spider in file mode:
    
1. In `data_acqusition_framework/configs`, do the following:
    - Open `config.json` and change `language` and `type` to your respective use case.
    
    - Open `storage_config.json` and change `bucket` and `channel_blob_path` to your respective gcp paths.(For more info on these fields, scroll above to Bucket configuration)
    
    - Open `youtube_pipeline_config.py` and do the following:
        - change `mode` to `file`(eg: mode='file').
        - change `source_name` to your requirement so that videos get downloaded to that folder in google storage bucket. 
    
2. Next Steps:
    - Create a file in the following format:
      
        eg. `source_name.csv` with content (license column is optional):
         Here `source_name` in `source_name.csv` is the name you gave in youtube_pipeline_config.py file. It should be the same.
         
        ```
            video_url,speaker_name,speaker_gender,license
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1vW_ZikA5o,Ram_Singh,male,Creative Commons
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o82HIOgozi8,John_Doe,male,Standard Youtube
            ...
         ```
      
    - Now to upload this file to google cloud storage do the following:
        - Open the `channel_blob_path` folder that you gave in `storage_config.json` and create a folder there named `data_to_be_scraped`.
        - Upload the file that you created with previous step to this folder.
    - From the project root folder, run the following command:
      
        ```
         scrapy crawl datacollector_youtube --set=ITEM_PIPELINES='{"data_acquisition_framework.pipelines.youtube_api_pipeline.YoutubeApiPipeline": 1}'
        ```
      
    - This will start fetching the videos mentioned in the file from youtube and download them to bucket.
